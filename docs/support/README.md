# Support
We believe in an open support system, so MC tries to minimize the amount of private communication. This restriction on private communication forces us to use novel ways of communicating with our costumers.
## Ordering Support
When a user purchases a kit from us all support for said kit will be done via our shopping website.
All of the communication that should go through this site are:
* Issues with Shipping
* Defective or broken hardware
* All issues concerning the arrival of the kit

## Usage Support
All of the usage support will be done via our [desktop multisig app](https://github.com/DecentralizeJustice/MultisigCryptoDesktop). The app will simply allow you to ask support for help. The app will then send a message to MC support staff. MC support will then post the question to our twitter, @ [multisigsupport](https://twitter.com/multisigSupport). We will then answer the question from our offical page @[multisigCrypto](https://twitter.com/multisigCrypto).  The public may also answer your question. We insist on having a one way support flow for security reasons. The desktop app is secured via being open source on github. If we were to use a traditional means of support such as a crm tool or email, this would insert another attack vector into the system, an attack vector that is extremely hard to prevent. Our crm or email could be attacked, and this could lead the users to receiving false information and loosing their keys. If our twitter handle succumbs to an attack, the entire world will be able to see this and advise the user to not follow the fraudulent advice. This means of public communication also allows for a public resource of questions, so as to cut down on total support necessary.
