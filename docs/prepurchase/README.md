# Pre-Purchase
## Risk
### Privacy
The main risk that users face in the pre-purchase phase of Multisig Crypto is their privacy.
The less information that is reveled about a user during the pre-purchase phase, the more secure
their experience will be with cryptocurrency and MC specifically. Any information leaked during the pre-purchase phase can lead to attacks later in the users use of MC.
## Examples
### Email Phishing
Email phishing is when an attacker acquires the email of users of a crypto service. The attacker then
sends emails to the users, often posing as  support staff. The attacker might want to trick the end user into installing malicious software or convince the user to send the attacker their private keys.

## Plan to Address Risks
### No Email Communication
We will not use email to communication with any users at all. We do not offer email signup via blogs, support via email, or any other form of email usage.
## Compromises
Although social media is a large attack surface and generally insecure on the privacy aspect MC will still use it. This is due to the fact that social medial is the main way that people hear about products and form community. MC will have a media account on all the major platforms. If we did not have a presence on these platforms, attackers would have an easier time masquerading as MC also.
